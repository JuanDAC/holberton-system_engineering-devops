At  5 - 6 hours, from 10:00am, until 4:00pm, on my server, it was working like a normal day and aproximately 10:00am the server left working, for between on this event did not generate negative consequences for the users, but it did generate costs, since there was a backup which started when this service was stopped, which implied duplicated costs in execution time. 

for the team there were problems because they did not have access to the new server instance which implied further delays delays apparently the new instance did not have an enabled access through the ssh connection ports which generated the downtime only for the development team.  

the automated response to any server downtime was practically automated thanks to the two load balancer concurrences, the NGINX server started up correctly.
